Description: TraitScan is a powerful and fast trait subset algorithm for mult-trait GWAS. It can also test the association significance between multiple traits and a single genetic variant (SNP). By taking the trait correlations into account, TraitScan is more powerful than PheWAS under scenarios with sparse and moderate true signals. TraitScan also has a linear computational time over the number of traits and thus can handle dozens to hundreds of traits. To run the TraitScan algorithm, first a Monte Carlo simulation is required using \code{TraitScan.MC}. Alternatively, pre-calculated null distributions are also available online: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qZsJLrrvpMERxvqeCByDpNhYI7PccbUw?usp=sharing.  With the summary-level GWAS data available, \code{TraitScan.main} can run the test and identify a subset of traits most likely associated with the SNP.
    The paper draft of TraitScan is under prepration.
